My apologies for the late submission

Tony, I have added a gallery with links to my index.html home page. However I was not able to make the images with their labels and a href links into an array sucessfully. So what I have done to at least demonstrate that I have some understanding of loops is make the gallery page a for-each loop of images. I apologize for not being able to successfuly meet the exact requirements of combining these two concepts.
