Tony. I have successfully created a database of the images from my assignment 2. I have deployed a database driven gallery to Heroku and MongoDB Atlas. However after a sucessful "deploy branch" on Heroku, I eventually get and "application error" when I want to view the page. I am fairly confident the problem is not with my model/schema, or the database.
